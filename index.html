                        <div class="matter">Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding. The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat. The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball into the field of play, allowing its players to run the bases, having them advance counter-clockwise. </div>

                            <div class="matter">Throughout my time as a cricketer I have seen many different styles and techniques when catching a cricket ball.
                                Different types of catches mean a fielder will call upon a different catching technique.
                                For a high catch, use the “reverse cup” method. Attempt to catch at eye-level and keep your hand high. Watch the ball the whole time until it hits your hands. The correct technique is

                                    We seem to work on the things that we like, and ignore the things we don’t. We’d rather perfect our right-foot shooting and blissfully ignore the fact that we couldn’t hit a barn-door with our left foot.
