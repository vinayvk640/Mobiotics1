                        <div class="matter">Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding. The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat. The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball into the field of play, allowing its players to run the bases, having them advance counter-clockwise. </div>

                            <div class="matter">Throughout my time as a cricketer I have seen many different styles and techniques when catching a cricket ball.
                                Different types of catches mean a fielder will call upon a different catching technique.
                                For a high catch, use the “reverse cup” method. Attempt to catch at eye-level and keep your hand high. Watch the ball the whole time until it hits your hands. The correct technique is
